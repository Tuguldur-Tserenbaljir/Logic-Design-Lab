Thanks for submitting your assignment 2!  The comments from us are summarized as follows.

 

RCA:

- Some lines are missing or cut off in the picture of the basic part.

- Try to avoid overlapping or intersecting wires and ensure that all the wires are connected.

- Please refrain from pasting all the codes in your report.

 

Decode and execute:

- You have to explain your implementation instead of just pasting your code.

- Wrong file name for the testbench.

- Incorrect use of Universal_Gate module, you might want to check Universal_Gate.v again.

 

CLA:

- You can try using $display to verify your results.

 

Multiplier:

Please describe your testbench in more details.

 

Testbench:

- Please explain the code you provided, rather than just put them in the report.

- Using additional graph to help with your explanation is good.

 

FPGA:

- Please refrain from pasting all the codes in the report.

- It is recommended to use kmap to simplify the implementation of fpga.

 

What you have learned from Lab 2:

- Thanks for sharing a very detailed summary of what you have learned from this lab.

- Great to know that you have learned how to implement the two adders and the multiplier by gate-level Verilog.

- Nice FPGA demonstration and good implementation on the seven segment display.

 

 

Lastly, thanks again for all the hard works on assignment 2. :)
