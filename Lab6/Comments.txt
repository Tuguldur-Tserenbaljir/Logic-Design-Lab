Thanks for submitting your assignment 6!  The comments from us are summarized as follows.

 

FPGA-Chip2chip:

- Really clear explanation

 

FPGA-Slot:

 

 

FPGA-Car:

Parameters should be declared within modules. Besides, there are multiple syntax error in your code. Such as a variable can't use with 'assign' after declared 'reg'.

If you see this comment before deadline of final project, I suggest you review the basic coding tutorials of verilog.

 

WHYL:

- I am glad to know that you have learned how to work with the sensors. I was just curious how you connect HDMI to the FPGA board? (I assumed that you meant VGA?)

- Great to know that you can now write Verilog in a more efficient way. :)

- If you donâ€™t understand certain parts, you are always welcome to post your questions on the EEClass forum.

 

 

Lastly, thanks again for all the hard works on assignment 6. :)
