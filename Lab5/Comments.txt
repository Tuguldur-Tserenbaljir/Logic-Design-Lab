Thanks for submitting your assignment 5!  The comments from us are summarized as follows.

 

Sliding_Window_Sequence_Detector:

- The block diagram can be more detailed.

 

Traffic_Light_Controller:

- Please draw the block diagram in more detail.

 

Greatest_Common_Divisor:

- The logic diagram is too high level, please draw what's inside the Memory Block

- The testcase should cover more possibilities, such as when one of the input is 0

 

Booth_Multiplier_4bit:

The explaination is too vague.

 

FPGA Vending_Machine:

- File DNE

 

FPGA Music:

- The explanation is clear.

- Please submit the code of Music fpga.

 

What have you learned from Lab 5:

- Good to know that you have learned the peripheral devices and how they can be used together with FPGA.

- Just wondering if there is any other things or problems that you have learned from this lab? 

 

 

 

Lastly, thanks again for all the hard works on assignment 5. :)
