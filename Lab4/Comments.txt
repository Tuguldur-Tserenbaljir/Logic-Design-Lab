Thanks for submitting your assignment 4!  The comments from us are summarized as follows.

 

Content_Addressable_Memory:

- The diagram should be more detailed.

 

Scan_Chain_Design:

The ports of the MUXes are opposite. In addition, the port number of the MUX is too small.

 

Built_In_Self_Test:

- Very clear and detailed explanation

 

Mealy_Sequence_Detector:

- Block diagram not detailed enough.

 

FPGA:

- On line 144, you didn't specified the bit count.

- No block diagram

 

What you have learned from Lab 4:

- It is great to know that you have learned how to use FSM, the difference between Moore and Mealy machines, and the concepts of scan chain.

- Actually, CAM is not necessary “faster” than RAM. CAM is just another type of memory with a different function. It takes several bits of data inputs and tells us the address of it. On the other hand, a regular memory takes an address as its input and gives us the data. They differ in their function, but not the speed.

- Thanks for Jason’s help to assist Tuguldur. Actually, it is not required to differentiate between a hit and multiple hits. As long as their is a hit, you can just output the smallest address of it.

 

 

 

Lastly, thanks again for all the hard works on assignment 4. :)
